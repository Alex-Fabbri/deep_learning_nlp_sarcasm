Vi 'd like to see dna morph into such things ! you based this ( and other claims ) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a ) did n't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b ) had the limitations and you did n't bother to relay this information to the forum . you then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are . any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection . this is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program , and draws attention to what `` morals '' should be drawn out of the biomorphs .

Vso , in an attempt to deal with this problem , gould and eldredge came up with a theory called , punctuated equilibrium . actually , the fossil record does support it . both eldredge and gould have discussed it . both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . these changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another . but given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population , and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do n't expect to find many examples in the fossil record . it is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . the fossil record just is n't fine grained enough to see the rapid ( 50-60 thousand years ) changes .

'' why has n't one other creature on earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution ? if evo is real , then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that were n't forced into extinction , but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever . and that is my claim and belief .

Vwhat it does show , empirically , are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals , but by the organism 's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage . i will stop quoting here . do n't want people to have too big a read . actually toe is n't all that random . to a certain degree yes . but sexual selection aka a part of the toe . dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change . that change will be enhanced almost exponentially . because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring . and the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring . so no instant eyes or anything like that . i think that 's what you were implying . sorry for responding in kronus 's stead . i 'm sure he can defend himself but i found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you did n't have .

Vsome may believe that it 's the unadulterated word of god , but looking at the above passage it 's also easy to believe that it 's also the work of common people.the rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line , and i believe i 've shown that a reasonable person might not , so i 'm going to skip to your next paragraph . so what about jesus ' life is credible if the source is unreliable ? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves ? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead ? what did the authors get right ? i mean , i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace . but you dont . so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did ? it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true , otherwise you can not follow a pattrn you dont have .

Vif this were the case than non-humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life . no your question is n't about 'right to life ' , but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life ' ? and my answer is absolutely yes ! at the living single cell , when the unique properties of a complete human being is created , it is living , not dead . who has a right to kill another human being 's living existance ? no one has that right in a civil society , but we have n't reached that society yet , but one day maybe .

'' well , the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it 's applicability at this point -- one was a property issue ( also rooted in deep prejudice ) , the other is a morality issue . many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and not prejudice . the same ca n't be said for slavery . there are many ways that the analogy does n't work and that 's just one of them . in fact , it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage . after all , the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights -- rights that they should n't have had .

Vthis accomplishes nothing besides giving you the self-satisfaction of touting your religiosity so that you can pat yourself on the back . what makes you think they 're not true ? jesus arose from the dead . that 's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history , whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not . many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale . none succeeded and a number became believers . you guys are playing with absolute fire . if you 're wrong ( and you are ) , you 're screwed big time . big time and forever . do you feel lucky ? well , do you ?

Vtherefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula ( no other factors involved ) . that is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects ( physically anyway ) . killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her . by contrast , a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion . i would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here , that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.your reasoning that a woman , using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ , can withhold her bodily resources `` until the newborn dies '' as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty .

Vat the same time in order for insurers to stay profitable , they need to not pay for treatment for people with expensive conditions . and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance ? or for credit cards , for that matter ? the cost of a policy , or card , is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer . do n't want to pay high premiums , take the risk on yourself . period . i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another 's morality . we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know .

Vof course , if the government was becoming oppressive , it would likely implement gun control , so the absence of gun control is necessary to ensure that we do not take a plunge towards fascism ! not quite . to be more correct regarding government and guns , the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.our political philosophy is very clear on this : '' that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it '' - declearation of independaceyou have the right to try and revolt with violence . you do n't have the right to win a revolt .

Vso why , in this gun-hater 's dream come true of congress , did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law ? i do n't find it surprising . it 's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . they do n't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy . they know that the republicans are going to hit them with everything they 've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the democrats wanting to take away people 's guns would hurt them . the republicans learned during the clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in congress . it 's all politics .

Vis n't that a true catch 22 for the unborn , and a contradiction in the law ? because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case . as to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely . on the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman and obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - without the consent of the woman . in other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.and yes prior to her death ( assumming all other requirements were met ) she could have at her choice and un-coerced have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty . but that would of course be much different .

Van evolutionary mutation of a gene is : a new and useful gene that never b4 existed , bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed . actually , there is no such thing as `` an evolutionary mutation of a gene . '' a mutation is a mutation . for evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they do n't require new structures nor structures.here 's a little mental exercise for you . at most , a person can have only two alleles for any gene . this would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists . it would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene . now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles , sometimes more , sometimes less . where did all of those alleles come from ?

Vgood to know , to pull out in future threads , though . i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate . as for my personal take , 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that . do you disagree ? prejean should not have lied about it . anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy . seeing some of hilton 's work , i do n't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody . i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about ' is exactly why he was chosen .

Vor is it just that when he gives you evidence that counters your ignorance on his religion , your perceived opinion of mormonism is thus null and void ? thanks for that , jason . in esdraelon 's defense , there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context , and morph them into something that looks like what he described . ( a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe . ) this is not the actual belief of lds . this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression . it 's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine . in other words , i 'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression .

Vthe only reason obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff , hispanics want no borders , and most women do n't know or do n't care how bad the obama liberals are digging america into the ground financially . and you wonder why people call `` republicans '' racist , women hating bigots .

Vi am interested in what supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society . that 's certainly your right , but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda , not a scientific one . he may want it disguised as a scientific one , but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire .

Vit can certainly be a false theory , however , you can rationally show that it is or is not ( to the degree determined by your evidence ) . again , it 's not just 'evidence ' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory ' .

Vi try to love everyone but it 's hard for me to love somebody who kills an innocent child.i am pro life ! so you are pro-life and you hate liberals ? actually republicans are being liberal in this case ( liberal=bigger government , more laws ) . but i 'll assume you mean democrats on this . what if the baby is a democrat ? if it 's a democratic parent it 's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal .

Vsyria had nothing to do with that attack.ever had an attack of reality , gman ? simone , read the sentence again please . it was `` saving lives is `` not just '' a republican goal . '' it concerns the subject of abortion . the only way it relates to the politics of iraq , is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to `` volunteer '' their services for iraq . i ca n't let one statement you made go though . terrorist continue to terrorize us ? where have they attacked in the u.s. since 9-11 ? consider continuing this in an appropriate thread .
