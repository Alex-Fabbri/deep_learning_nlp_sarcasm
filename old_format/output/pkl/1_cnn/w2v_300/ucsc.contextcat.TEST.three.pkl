( but he 's not who you think he is ) . it 's a funny proof which i do n't think christians would agree this definition was god . but basically it 's saying that take the set of all human beings . call the greatest god . god exists.not only that , but the final conclusion is one of the premises . the proof is one big circle : )

V( 6 ) natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds , but actually tends to preserve the present kinds , since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no `` survival '' value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning . actually , natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment . but environments tend to change . i do n't know what that `` incipient organ '' junk is supposed to mean . is that another way of saying `` what good is half a wing . '' well , check out a penguin to find out . look at a seal flipper . it has the same bones , arranged in the same way as a monkey . what good is it for a land animal ? and what does `` fully functional '' mean ? what function ? perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example . they were good for catching prey and climbing , just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors . but those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly .

Vpg/ 52 so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body . the genes decided the arrangement of cells , the number of fingers , etc.the body , the cells , and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence .

( for comparison , the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this ) . so , are you saying the first model is wrong ? the error seems to be pretty tiny ( by most standards ) . what about the second ?

Vcertainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human . but growth is fairly irrelevant . my sperm can grow into a human too , and have mental existence , yet ejaculating is n't murder . it just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line , therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right now . not what it was or could possibly be.that seems reasonable to me .

Vif literal creationism is indeed true , why do we not find strata with species from all eras mixed together ? we do ... ... most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to toe -- did not die at the same time . for example , many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other `` ancient '' bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand . of course evolutionists will come back and claim `` erosion '' with no evidence of such , not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.i 've got a 900-page book called `` hidden archeology '' ( cremo ) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the `` wrong '' strata . your assertion is blatantly false .

Vjames . persecution on political grounds ? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here . he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption ( bribing politicians ) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin . now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government ... and he lays all this out to a british newspaper . political persecution if he returns ? probably not . execution for treason ? that one seems more likely . in the extradition rhetoric arena , the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british .

' the calculus used to say this was a 'just ' war is a very dangerous one , and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts ( how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities ' that make it pose an 'imminent threat ' ? at the very least , the entire mid-east ( arab/israel ) would explode under that logic ) .

Vit is often 'taught ' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally : indeed , a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed , and this requires a more direct and deliberate move : thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs . daniel dennett asks , how did just one species , homo sapiens , acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people 's lives ? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive ' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes ' of natural events in pre-scientific societies . to give just one example : the rise and fall of the tides were observed , but not understood . so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god ( or gods ) etc . i think this is a pretty commonplace answer , but not necessarily wrong . why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science ? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need ' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems ( to me ) the most promising speculation .

Vgun-making as a cottage industry you must be joking . i 'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane . then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us ? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us , but we do n't .

V`` that may be true , but it is n't harmful so i doubt it really should be on the list . '' well that may be your contention , but medically that is not necessarily true . maybe being gay does n't mean you are suicidal or depressed , but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero . that in itself is a wake up call . depression and suicide are harmful , even if it does n't touch you personally . if it were as simple as you say the apa would n't be re-evaluating `` reorientation therapies '' would they and with positive critiques too . you would n't have prominent gay activists like camile paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .

Vand the probability of a and b in many generations is lower than just a. actually , if you look at the example i 've given , that 's false . the probability of a in one organism may be low , but the probability of a in some organism approaches 100 % as the population and the number of generations gets larger . and if a is useful and comes to dominate the population , then the probability of an ab individual appearing then also tends towards 100 % . in the example above , the chance of an ab mutant occurring , if a and b are substantially useful mutations , is almost a dead certainty . it would be amazing if they did n't stack . so saying that ab occurring is less likely than a is misleading at best , downright wrong at worst . behe is clearly misapplying probability theory .

'' gaytheist , '' the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as iidb and tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles . the little xxxx liar atheist claimed to the author that i used his paper as `` evidence '' of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she could n't back up when i pressed her on it . this was merely his response to her strawman lie . funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is .

Vwhat was truncated ? the gene and therefore the enzyme it produces . lpl is the designation for a gene that encodes lipoprotein lipase , an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins . the actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide . one study was able to identify 3 common snps ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) in the coding region of the gene , 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in european populations . the third snp converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long . thus , the enzyme has been truncated . the resulting enzyme , lpl s447x , is functional . in fact , it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure . other truncations result in non-functional enzymes .

Vin fact there maybe no brain activity until the end of the first trimester . actually , at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins . the nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus . it is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before . it is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.it is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb ( 23-24 weeks ) , though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious . this point probably wo n't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing .

Vtaking revenge on the wicked is god 's perogative . irrelevant . what about the common people that were n't blessed with god 's son ? revenge : definition , synonyms from answers.com tr.v. , -venged , -venging , -venges . 1. to inflict punishment in return for ( injury or insult ) . 2. to seek or take vengeance for ( oneself or another person ) ; avenge . n. 1. the act of taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs ; retaliation . 2. something done in vengeance ; a retaliatory measure . 3. a desire for revenge ; spite or vindictiveness . 4. an opportunity to retaliate , as by a return sports match after a defeat . tell me , simone , how exactly does using force to defend oneself qualify as revenge ? revenge is tracking down the person that wronged you and cutting their throat when they 're at their most vulnerable . revenge is n't killing your attacker because you 're in fear of your own life .

Vthe kkk use of firearms is n't a legal and lawful use , as dictated in the heller ruling.next argument please ! actually , as long as any group is not breaking laws , their ownership of guns is legal . the kkk can even own guns as long as the kkk is abiding by the law . i noticed brady refered to the kkk as a mob , i get the picture brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason , that we are mobs as well , but when his side gathers they are an organization . and no brady , i dont belong to or associate with hate groups .

Vmost evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a `` big bang . '' but recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology is n't limited to evolutionsits . in fact , most other scientists also believe so , most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists , who are directly concerned with the early universe . evolutionists , even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution , are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists .

Vwhat chance does an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on killing him ? i think they have more of a chance becasue , while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby , it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby is n't a baby . even in the animal kingdom ( which we are all part of ) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species . evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup ( i have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it , though they could have . i am told this is because of the stubby nose , which shows the coyotes that it is , indeed , a puppy , even though it looks unfamiliar to them ) .

Vcan you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally ( without going through selection ) validates darwinism , which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted ? it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered . nobody knew the mechanism till that era . and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account . genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes ( many are either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they are subject to selection . why do you think otherwise ? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations .

Vyou would probably get much more out of it if you posted a question here , let people reply , then carry on in a similar way asking questions ( even related to replies ) and getting reponses . everyone is welcome to give their opinion on public gun possession here-whether you 're for or against gun control ( or does gun possession justifies itself ) and please state the reasons as well . i would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue .

Vi wo n't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal did n't even exist . and i do n't expect you to . the reason you wo n't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you can not prove that all men are not created equal .

Vsorry , but your apologetics are lame . 'lame apologetics ' ? well , i guess if you say so , with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth , it would be futile to contradict you . at least you have n't accused me of being 'prejudiced ' against science . james .

Vwe really are going around in circles on this ... ... ..my bible through the rcc and jesus christ says all life is sacred including that life in the womb ... ... ... then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in hosea 13:16.what did they ever do to god ? does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed . un born members who could n't have possibly done anything to god !

Vwait a minute , i fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not . because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior . abstinence until marriage is still the best way .

Vwithin science classrooms , science is and should remain pre-eminent , so that people can make informed decisions . but it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts . there 's no indication that they 're getting it done .

Vyoutube - fallacy of id and creationism-false dichotomy [ reloaded ] ridiculous . if ic can not support id , id has absolutely nothing going for it , right ? including their supporters of ic , since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id . behe is wrong , dembski is wrong , johnson is wrong , every id supporter is wrong for using ic , because freedom the great thinks it 's wrong . daewoo : ic is irreducible complexity , the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process , but had to have been formed all at once , by a designer with a function in mind . id is intelligent design , creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin , a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect . it failed . michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic .

Vif god could create the world in 7 days then he sure as hell could get someone pregnant . so parthenegenic births are always female . where did the x chromosome come from ? is this another case of `` poof , it was a miracle '' when faced with reality ?

Vif the proteins interlock or attach , they can form new combined structures . folding proteins ... show me where and how this happens . why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another ? if this is happening all the time we 'd see more mutations all the time.good theory you 've got there . saying something can happen does n't mean that it does !

Vunsatisfied with just 10 , they kept saying `` oh , sure , but what about in this situation , and this situation , and what about this ... '' okay , so if we only need 10 laws then they must be , without any doubt , the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history . not coveting your neighbor 's oxen made the list ? why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people ? that did n't even make the list . if those 10 things were all that god intended to impart on mankind i have to question his mental competance .
