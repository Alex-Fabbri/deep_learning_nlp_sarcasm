Vso far there is no mechanism for an organism to grow wings when it previously had none . i know this may seem obvious to most people , but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists . birds are tetrapods , as are amphibians , reptiles , and mammals . birds did n't just grow wings . wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers . perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers , probably for thermoregulation . saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none . you see , mankind 's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds .

Vthe life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.the reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins : the moment the egg and sperm form , the moment of conception , first division and implantation , the moment the heart starts to beat , the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life . oh yeahrubbish rubbish , scientifically speaking , human life ( using a most bsic term ) begins at conception . the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna . seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it . if you are driving at night an you `` think '' you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gon na drive over that person . instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . if you dont like that example , consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes .

Vironically , when i have publicaly advanced the idea that god is generally compatable with evolution , i find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas , but many believers are dumbfounded . i believe that 's true , and as a `` believer '' ( creationist ) , here is what is hard to understand about that ; in matthew , 12:30 , jesus says `` he who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters '' . it is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from jesus , and would seek to be `` with '' him , while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves `` not with '' him . yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to ( usually politically ) be `` with '' agnostics and atheists , and separate themselves from creationists . if they 're genuine christians , knowing about the warnings in the bible about false teachings , how can they be comfortable with that ? miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should n't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist .

( not my parents -- on a mankind scale ) is it more logical than to assume that i generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic ? generated due to `` miraculous '' odds ? i 'm not sure what the numbers are . i think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2 . i came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic -- i am a rational being . i could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter . i came from a rational source .

Vwhy has n't natural selection weeded out species with their inferior `` optical vision '' and given them all echolocation , which would allow them superior senses in day and night , rather than just daytime ? because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis . for bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage , allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species . for ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals , it would be of marginal or zero benefit , given the 'noise ' in their immediate surroundings .

Vit 's disingenuous to suggest that gay people have suffered anywhere near the same level of oppression . 'if it 's beside the point ' the why bring it up , jyoshu . why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth ' ? and your right wing talking points are stale and tired . comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking ' . and incidentally , why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people ? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people ? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people . there are female gay people that suffered along with the women . on top of such discrimination , gay people may have had no family support . some were probably lobotomized against their wishes . some were raped , some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about . no , my friend . it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not .

V*note : i am speaking within the context of the united states , and its constitution . i think that we 've got to draw a line at some point , to demarcate between adult and child . where ever we do draw it , it will seem , in some situations to be arbitrary . if we made it 20 , the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences ( at least as it applies to the death penalty , they can be tried as adults w/o death ) . we do n't execute people who ca n't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that , under 18 you ca n't fully comprehend criminal actions .

Vconspiracy theorists never look that far back , but when you start looking that far back , it makes alot more sense . this has nothing to do with my post . you do n't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy . i 'm an advocate of science , and even i admit that , especially at the quantum level , shit gets crazy . particles being in two places at once , 95 % of the universe being undetectable , whole separate universes colliding to make new ones . it 's crazy yes , but it is also scientific . in fact , compared to science , the answers psychics provide are rather boring . i 'm impressed by the stuff i just listed , not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog .

Vi do n't know if one can consider this homeopathic medicine though.i guess i do n't know what 's being called homeopathic medicine these days.if someone comes up with something that works can they just call it homeopathic medicine and say that homeopathic medicine works ? because of your question `` what is your definition of pure '' , i now know how to make soap . i 'll never stink again ! ! ! and i think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds , and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis . ya know stuff that makes sense .

V) ... and here is the crux of the matter where i think libertarians are missing it : as one founding father said , `` there can be no liberty without virtue . '' someone else once said , `` intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings '' . if the god of the bible is right , a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of god . and when the sins of a nation reach their fullness ( in god 's eyes ) , that disfavor can turn to judgment ( genesis 15:16 , deuteronomy chapter 28 - `` the blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience ) . therefore , while many of the libertarians mean well on liberal social issues , they nevertheless either do n't see the big picture , or they do n't believe it will occur .

Vthis animation is so true : http : //www.markfiore.com/animation/toys.html yes , virginia , there is a sweatshop in china ! economically it is great . heck , it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense . sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who can not find a job ? sending jobs over seas does n't hurt our economy but it does n't help billy who lost his job to it . i 'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here .

Vunfortunately until lower court cases build precedent to show that firearms ownership is a civil right and will be treated as such there is nothing that can be done when private individuals choose to prohibit firearms on said property . a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost , a private individual will get sued for assault , and false imprisonment at the least . there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison . you can ignore an illegal law with impunity . we have the ruling . we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases . you implied there were none and that is false . would you like to take a stab at nunn v , state of georgia for instance ? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier , oveturned case in people v zirillo . how can you miss so much ?

Vit does n't do this , because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends ' ... other than survival , and survival simply come about because organisms survive ( hence the tautology of `` survival of the fittest '' which darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to `` natural selection '' ) . as was pointed out in some of your own quotations , survival is not an 'end ' of natural selection . natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics . it is a statistical tendency . individual organisms may work to survive , but they also work to reproduce . that 's as close as it gets to `` purpose . '' and as you know , darwin 's favored term was natural selection . he never used the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' without also making a reference to natural selection . the opposite is not the case . since darwin 's time `` survival of the fittest '' has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory .

Vof course , if you get a muslim in here making similar claims to the claims that christianity makes , you will get an equal reaction from the same people who critize christianity ( for the exact same reasons ) but people start threads here all the time against christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not . it 's prejudice , pure and simple , and you 're no exception . now , one would think , being the supposedly non-christian enlightened person you are , you would simply say `` oh , i did n't realize that my posts came across as anti-christian sometimes , and that it indicates a prejudice on my part , and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking . '' i mean , one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on , as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking .

Vas to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by 'god ' . i asked on another thread , but it fits here as well ... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x ? before , i suggested that i could n't see a distinction , but after pondering it for awhile , i believe there is a distinction between the two : if one asserts that there is no god ( or gods ) , this is a belief in the absence of god . if one makes no assertions one way or another ( even internally ) , then this would be an absence of belief . i 'm not certain into which 'side ' atheism would fall , though i believe it would have to be the former , and therefore , a belief . the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me . but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic .
